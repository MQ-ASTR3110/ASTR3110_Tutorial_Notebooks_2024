    "\n",
    "In Tutorial 3 we used $\\chi^2_{\\rm model}$ difference between the model and data as a measure of *goodness of fit* and found the best-fitting model by minimizing its value. However, we often have *prior* independent measurements of the parameters we want to fit. We want this prior information to weight the total $\\chi^2$ value so that it prefers parameter values closer to our previous measurements. Each prior parameter estimate contributes its own $\\chi^2$ value. For example, for a parameter $p = p_{\\rm prior} \\pm \\sigma_{\\rm prior}$, the $\\chi^2_{\\rm prior}$ value is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\chi^2_{\\rm prior} = \\left(\\frac{p_{\\rm model} - p_{\\rm prior}}{\\sigma_{\\rm prior}}\\right)^2$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total $\\chi^2$ value is then given by the sum of all values: $\\chi^2 = \\chi^2_{\\rm model} + \\chi^2_{\\rm prior}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *likelihood* is a related way of assessing a model fit: *what is the probability, or likelhood $\\mathcal{L}$, of getting the observed data given particular values of parameters p?* For Gaussian distributed likelihoods the likelihood is related to $\\chi^2$ via\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L} = exp(-\\chi^2\\big/2)~~~~or~~~~-2~{\\rm ln}(\\mathcal{L}) = \\chi^2,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "so that $\\chi^2$ is often referred to as the 'log-likelihood'. Because $\\mathcal{L}$ is in log-space, likelihoods are *multiplied* to get the total $\\mathcal{L}$. From a numerical perspective, the log-likelihood is also a smaller number and less likely to run into computational limits.\n",

    "prior; it encodes the probability of the\n",

    "  priori* information about the parameter values. The final term ${\\rm Pr}(\\boldsymbol{d}|\\mathcal{M})$, known as the\n",
